    <h3>The 3 and Under Rule: Unlock Your Productivity</h3>
  </div>
	<div class="blogpp">
	  <p><strong>To-Do Lists Aren't Your Thing</strong></p>
	  <p>You're in high demand. You are in charge of a lot of people including yourself and your to-do list proves it. You've tried to write it down in the past, but it just falls by the wayside. Your list keeps getting longer and before you know it you're missing the important taks.</p>
	  <p><strong>Overload</strong></p>
	  <p>The truth is, many people are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of items on their list. Unable to figure out where to start some put down the list and pick up their phone to reward themselves for writing all of that. Their list for today has 30 items including cleaning gutters, washing the car, recording a demo cd, and taking the kids to soccer. An admirable list indeed, but at the end of the day if the kids made it to soccer, had a balanced home cooked meal, and they spent 30 minutes practicing guitar, how will they perceive that day? If they look at a list of 30 items and say I completed less than 1% they're going to feel bad about what was actually a productive and fulfilling day. </p>
	  <p><strong>Quality over Quantity</strong></p>
	  <p>Instead of writing yourself a list of 10 items each day keep it to no more than 3. Make them tasks that you can really commit to doing. If you are only able to get to two items then you've been a success and you'll see those items start ticking off the big list. When you are choosing items for your today-list try prioritizing those items with deadlines approaching first. For more help narrowing down your list check out <strong>The ABC's of Priorities</strong> or meet with one of our coaches.</p>

		<h3>The ABC's of Priorities</h3>
	</div>
		
	<div class="blogpp">
	  <p><strong>Too Much Too Do</strong></p>
	  <p>If you're like most of us today your to-do list has about 50 items and that's just what you've written down. It can be an overwhelming task to look at the larger list and determine what you should start with. There's an easy trick to categorize your list and make it easier to select which of them should be on your <strong>3 Items or Less List. </strong>If you learned the alphabet then you're golden. If not, rest easy, I'm only going to make you learn 4 of the 26 letters. Whew! We will categorize items into either A, B, C, or D. Bear with me I promise there's a treat.</p>
	  <p><strong>Category A -High Priority</strong></p>
	  <p>Category A is reserved for items where you will have a negative consequence if you do not complete them. For example, if you do not pay your bill on time you will get a late fee. If you do not complete your homework by deadline you will get a failing grade. Forgetting to call your sister on her birthday may result in being shut out. These are your top priority items. Some will have dates, some not. I encourage you to give yourself a deadline. You are much more likely to accomplish the task.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;<strong>Category B- A Little Help</strong></p>
	  <p>Category B is all the items you can ask for help with or delegate to someone else. Have a housefull of kids? Try enlisting their help with small chores around the house. Does your Aunt come over every 3rd Sunday for tea and offer to help you with wedding planning? Let her. If getting to the grocery store seems like a pipe dream remember services like InstaCart deliver food and booze today. There are a variety of meal prep services that will help you with preparing bulk meals to store in the freezer that reheat for delicious, balanced meals.</p>
	  <p><strong>Category C - See You Tomorrow</strong></p>
	  <p>Category C is where the bulk of your list will likely lie. These are items that you can put off to another day. Tasks like cleaning the gutters, 2019's meal planning, and calling Grandma. Many of us are so busy trying to create the life we want that we don't stop to say is this really important? Is there something else I should be doing? If you are having trouble deciding if the item is a category A or C ask yourself if I don't do it today will there be a consequence? If yes, it's an A and if not then it fits here in Category C.</p>
	  <p><strong>Category D - Fun, Fun, Fun</strong></p>
	  <p>Yes, we did it. A whole category dedicated to only items that are fun. These are all of the things that you want to do. Let's face it, life is short. We have a very limited amount of time on this planet and while we're doing all the things we need to it is vital that we take care of ourselves with activities that we want to do. This can be water skiing, coloring, rock climbing, learning a language, going to the Target Dollar Spot, the possibilities are endless.&nbsp;Don't have any? You better start now because this model depends on it.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;<strong>Only One Rule </strong></p>
	  <p> This is it kids! I promised you a treat. Your list MUST have an equal number of A's to D's. Yes, you heard that right. Every time you accomplish something you had to do from Category A congratulate yourself with a treat from Category D. It is so vital to stay motivated and to celebrate every moment in life. Make sure your list has items of varied time, so you're not waiting until your trip to Colorado before you get anything else done. It's all about balance. Our most popular daily journal format is available in our downloads section if you're ready to take it to the next level.</p>
